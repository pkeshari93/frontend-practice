#Frontend Development practice

- This repository is dedicated towards practising and improving my HTML5, CSS, 
  and JavaScript skills

- For the process that I have taken up is, I would go around applications like
  Pinterest and Dribbble to find some designs that inspire me and the I recreate
  them using my own knowldege or skils

- Getting stuck usually means its time to LEARN, so I will look around online
  resources, look at YouTube do a lot of trial and error until I get what I want
